I started by writing notes on paper. Since it became tedious, I will move all notes from paper to Obsidian in some time. I will skip first chapters, since I did not note them at all.

Chapters:
	[[I FOUNDATIONS]]
	[[II LOW-LEVEL ENGINE SYSTEMS]] 

## State of book progress:
- [x] Read chapter Subsystem start-up and shut-down
- [x] Read chapter Memory Management
- [x] Read chapter Containers
- [ ] Read chapter Strings
- [ ] Move previous notes to **obsidian**
