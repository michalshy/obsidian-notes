I started by writing notes on paper. Since it became tedious, I will move all notes from paper to Obsidian in some time. I will skip first chapters, since I did not note them at all.

[[Math in Game Engines]] - Chapter 5
[[Low-Level Engine Systems]] - Chapter 6 

## State of book
- [ ] Read chapter 6
- [ ] Move previous notes to **obsidian**
