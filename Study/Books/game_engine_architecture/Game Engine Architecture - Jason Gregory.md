I started by writing notes on paper. Since it became tedious, I will move all notes from paper to Obsidian in some time. I will skip first chapters, since I did not note them at all.

Chapters:
- [[I FOUNDATIONS]] - tbd
- [[6 Engine Support Systems]]
- [[7 Resources and the File System]]
- [[8 The Game Loop and Real-Time Simulation]]
- [[9 Human Interfaces Devices]]
