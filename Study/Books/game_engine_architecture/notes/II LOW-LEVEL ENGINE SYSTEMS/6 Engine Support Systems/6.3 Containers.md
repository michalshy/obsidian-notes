## Containers kinds
The job of container is to house and manage zero or more data elements.
Commonly used containers (but not all of their kinds):
- *Array* - ordered, contiguous collection of elements accessed by index. Length usually statically defined at compile time. Might be multidimensional. (`int a[5]`)
- *Dynamic array* - an array which length might be defined dynamically at runtime. (`std::vector`)
- *Linked list*  - an ordered collection which is not contiguous in memory, rather linked one to another by pointers (`std::list`) 
- *Stack* - container that supports *LIFO*/*FILO* model for adding and removing elements (`std::stack`)
- *Queue* - supports *FIFO* model for adding and removing elements (`std::queue`)
- *Deque* - double-ended queue which supports efficient insertion and removal at both sides of queue (`std::deque`)
- *Tree* - container which elements are grouped hierarchically. Each node has zero or one parent and zero or more children. It is special case of *DAG* 
- *Binary search tree*  - tree in which each node has at most 2 children, with an order property to keep the nodes sorted by some defined criteria. There are various kinds of BST, like red-black trees, splay trees, AVL trees.
- *Binary heap* - a binary tree that maintains itself in sorted order via two rules: *shape property* which specifies that tree must be fully filled and that the last row is filled from left to right; and the *heap property* which states that each node is, by some criteria, "greater than", "equal to" etc. all of its children.
- *Priority queue* - permits adding in any order, but removing order is specified by some criteria (**priority**). Typically implemented as a *heap* (`std::priority_queue`) but other implementations are possible. Supports only retrieve of the highest priority element.
- *Dictionary* - table of key-value pairs. Is also known as a map or hash map, **although hash table is just one possible implementation of dictionary.** (`std::map`)
- *Set* - guarantees all elements are unique - dictionary with keys only.
- *Graph* - nodes connected to each other by unidirectional or bidirectional pathways in arbitrary pattern.
- *Directed acyclic graph (DAG)* - nodes with unidirectional interconnections with no cycles (there is no nonempty path that starts and ends on the same node).
## Containers operations
Some common algorithms used in containers manipulations:
- *Insert*
- *Remove* - might need *find* operation.
- *Sequential access* - iterating over items in some predefined way.
- *Random access* - accessing item in an arbitrary order.
- *Find* - there are all sorts of find operation, including finding in reverse, finding multiple elements etc.
- *Sort* - sort contents of container according to some criteria.
## Iterators
An iterator "knows" how to efficiently visit the elements of particular container. It acts similar to index or pointer - **refers to one element, can be advanced to next element and provides mechanism for testing if all elements were visited**. 
Example with no iterators and with iterators:
```
void processArray(int container[], int numElements)
{
	int* pBegin = &container[0];
	int* pEnd = &container[numElements];
	for(int* p = pBegin; p != pEnd; p++)
	{
		int el = *p;
		//process el
	}
}
void processList(std::list<int>& container)
{
	std::list<int>::iterator pBegin = container.begin();
	std::list<int>::iterator pEnd = container.end();
	
	for(int* p = pBegin; p != pEnd; p++)
	{
		int el = *p;
		//process el
	}
}
```
Benefits:
- iterator is not breaking encapsulation
- iterator simplifies the process of iterating.
### Preincrement vs Postincrement
Preincrement introduces *data dependency*. On a deeply pipelined CPU, this introduces stall!
There shouldn't be any difference between those operators usually, since any good compiler recognizes that the value of the variable isn't used in *update_expr*. If it would be used, postincrement is preferable.
Exception of this is when programmer is working with overloaded increment operators, like in our iterators. Since postincrementation returns unmodified copy of the object called, size might be big in complex classes, thus using preincrementation might be faster in those cases.

## Algorithmic complexity
To choose container, we should take performance and memory characteristics into consideration.
We usually search for time complexity with big O notation
e.g T = O(n<sup>2</sup>)
If the algorithm execution does not depend of container size it is O(1).
If it visits all of them once it is O(n).
If loops are nested it's O(n<sup>2</sup>)
If divide-and-conquer approach is used, as in binary search, we would expect that only log<sub>2</sub>n + 1 elements will be visited, hence it is O(log<sub>2</sub>n).
We should consider memory layout as well.
Array or vector stores elements in contiguous way in memory and requires no overhead storage. This makes those containers much more cache friendly. So, for high speed, small algorithms, arrays are usually better than linked lists.
Linked list on the other hand is better in situation where speed of removing or inserting elements is important, rather than access.
## Custom Container class
Pros of providing custom built container classes:
- total control
- opportunities for optimization
- customizability
- elimination of external dependencies
- control over concurrent data structures
### To build or not to build
Where to obtain implementations of the types and algorithms we use. As game engine designers, there are three options:
- Build the needed data structures manually
- Make use of the STL-style containers provided  by the C++ standard library.
- Rely on a third-party library such as *Boost*.
Pros and cons of each approach.
#### C++ STL
Benefits:
- rich set of features
- robust and fully portable implementations
Drawbacks:
- hard to understand header files
- general-purpose container is often slower than fine tuned specific crafted container
- generic container may consume more memory than custom one
- **STL does a lot of dynamic memory allocation, it is challenging to control its appetite for memory**
- templated allocator system provided by STL **is not** flexible enough to work with some allocator, like stack-based one [[6.2 Memory management#Stack allocator]] 

> [!NOTE] Fact
> Naughty Dog prohibits use of STL containers in runtime game code. Permit to use them is for offline tools.

#### Boost
Pros:
- provides a lot of useful facilities not available in the C++ standard library.
- in some cases, **boost** provides alternatives or work-arounds for problems with the design or implementation of some classes in STL
- does great job at handling some complex problems like smart pointers (**important: handles are preferable**)
- very good documentation
Cons:
- most of the boost classes are templates, so some of libraries are big, since set of header is needed, these libraries might not be feasible for use in very small-scale game projects
- if you encounter bug, it is your or your team job to work around it or fix it

## Dynamic Arrays and chunky allocations
*Fixed size C-style arrays* are often used in game programming, because they require no memory allocation, are cache-friendly and support many common operations.
When size can not be determined a priori, *linked list* or *dynamic array* tend to be useful.
*Dynamic array* is used wherever memory characteristics and performance is important.
The simplest implementation of dynamic array is to allocate *n*
byte static array and grow it only if there is attempt made to add more than *n* elements to it. At some point size of array like this is "high water mark".
If you can establish mark like this, better just allocate this size of an array at the beginning of the engine.
Growing of array might be costly due to reallocation of data and copying cost.
It can also lead to fragmentation.
**Dynamic arrays are best in the development stage, where fixed size is unsure, but whenever array might be changed to fixed size, it probably should be.**
## Dictionaries and Hash Tables
Dictionary is key-value pairs table. Value can be searched up quickly, given key. This kind of data is usually either as a binary search tree or as a hash table.
	In binary tree implementation, key-value is stored in the nodes of binary tree and the tree is maintained in key-sorted order. Looking up a value by key is O(logn).
	In hash table implementation, values are stored in fixed array, where their index is determined by hashing key value into integer (if it's not integer already). An index is calculated by taking modulo of the hashed key and array size. E.g. key of 3 in the hash table of 5 slots would be stored on index 3, while 6 on index 1. Finding a key-value pair is O(1) operation in absence of collisions.
### Collisions: Open and Closed Hash tables
It might be that 2 or more keys end up on the same slot in the hash table. This is **collision.** There are two basic ways to resolve them, giving raise to two hash tables:
- Open - collisions are resolved by storing more than one key-value pairs at each index, usually in the linked list manner. It is easy to implement, and does not impose upper bounds on how many pairs can be stored. However, it does require dynamically allocated memory every time new pair is added.

- Closed - collisions are resolved by *probing* until free vacant is found. It is more difficult to implement and imposes an upper limit on the number of pairs. It does not require dynamic memory allocation.
![[Pasted image 20250313183533.png]]
Closed hash tables are sometimes said to use *open addressing*.
Open hash tables are said to use an addressing method called *chaining*.
### Hashing
Given a key *k*, we want to generate an integer hash value *h* using the hash function *H* and then find the index *i* into the table as follows:
$$
\begin{align*}
	h = H(k),
	i = h\mod{N}
\end{align*}
$$
where *N* is the number of slots in the table. 
If the keys are unique integers, a hash function can be the identity function H(k) = k.
If the keys are unique 32-bit floats, a hash function may simply reinterpret float bits into 32-bit integer.
```
U32 hashFloat(float f)
{
	union
	{
		float m_asFloat;
		U32 m_asU32;
	} u;
	u.m_asFloat = f;
	return u.m_asU32;
}
```
If the key is string, string hashing function can be employed, which combines  ASCII or UTF codes of all the characters in the string into a single 32-bit integer value.
**Good hashing function minimize collision probability.**
**Also it has to be fast and DETERMINISTIC.**

### Implementing a Closed Hash Table
In a closed hash table, one can encounter collision. To resolve this behavior, probing is introduced. The simplest is linear probing. When index i is taken, try (i+1), (i+2) and so on (wrap around size from the beginning of an array). Another variation is to alternate searching forward and backwards (i+1), (i-1), (i+2) etc.
Linear probing tends to *clump up*. To avoid this, one can use **quadratic probing**. Formula is to start at the occupied index and use sequence (i +/- j<sup>2</sup>). So, we try (i+1<sup>2</sup>), (i-1<sup>2</sup>), (i+2<sup>2</sup>) and so on.
**When using closed hashing, size of prime number tends to yield best coverage with combination of quadratic probing.**
### Robin Hood Hashing
It is another method for closed hash tables, popular recently.
