On the surface, string can seem like a simple, fundamental data type.
Everyone who uses them, quickly recognizes wide range of design issues and constraints, all of which must be carefully accounted for
## The problem with strings
**How they should be stored and managed in the program?**
Problems:
- each string shown to user must be configurable (have ability to be translated to other languages)
- length of words, styles of letter or writing differs between languages
- strings are used internally to describe resources or elements of scene
Comparing or copying floats is constant time, but for strings
`strcmp` is O(n) as well as `strcpy`.
## String classes
Using `std::string` is convenient.
Might cause overhead in time efficiency.
**Passing C-style characters is fast, since 1st element address is passed via register and that is it. On the other hand, passing string might involve copying or dynamic memory allocation.**
> One situation in which a specialized string class does seem justifiable to me is when storing and managing file system paths. Here, a hypothetical Path class could add significant value over a raw C-style character array. For example, it might provide functions for extracting the filename, file extension or directory from the path. It might hide operating system differences by automatically converting Windows-style backslashes to UNIX-style forward slashes or some other operating system’s path separator.

## Unique identifiers
Game objects require unique id, which will let programmers reference to them.
E.g. in Pac-man we encounter game objects names "pac_man", "blinky", "pinky", "inky" and "clyde". This applies to meshes, materials, textures, audio clips, animations and so on!
**We need descriptiveness and flexibility of string, but with speed of an integer.**
### Hashed String Ids
Good solution is to hash strings. Game programmers sometimes use term *string id* for hashed string.
Collisions are of course possible, but solution is usually simple. Just alter the string a bit. 32-bit hash represents more than four billion possible values.
### Some implementation ideas
Most game engines permits hashing in runtime.
It is possible to make it at compile time, by enabling macro which will transform syntax `"any_string"_sid` to hashed integer at compile time.
The process of generating string id from a string is sometimes called *interning the string*. **In addition of hashing, string is usually added to a global string table.** Tools of the engine should also be capable of interning strings. This way, when tools generates data for engine, strings will already be cached.
*Interning* is slow. It is best to do it once.
```
static StringId sid_foo = internString("foo");
static StringId sid_bar = internString("bar");

void f(StringId id)
{
	if(id == sid_foo)
	{
	}
	else if(id == sid_bar)
	{
	}
}
```
Above example will be choose over next one
```
void f(StringId id)
{
	if(id == internString("foo"))
	{
	}
	else if(id == internString("bar"))
	{
	}
}
```
Possible implementation of `internString()`:
`stringid.h`
```
typedef U32 StringId;
extern StringId internString(const char* str);
```
`stringid.cpp`
```
static HashTable<StringId, const char*> gStringIdTable;

StringId internString(const char* str)
{
	StringId sid = hashCrc32(str);
	HashTable<StringId, const char*>::iterator it = gStringIdTable.find(sid);
	if(it == gStringTable.end())
	{
		gStringTable[sid] = strdup(str);
	}
	return sid;
}
```
Another idea is to wrap the string id and pointer into tiny class.
Macro SID("any_string") might be define to produce instance of this class with its hashed value produced by string literal syntax `"any_string"_sid`
#### Using debug memory for strings
When using string ids, the strings themselves are only kept around for human consumption. When you ship your game, you almost certainly won’t need the strings—the game itself should only ever use the ids. As such, it’s a good idea to store your string table in a region of memory that won’t exist in the retail game. For example, a PS3 development kit has 256 MiB of retail memory, plus an additional 256 MiB of “debug” memory that is not available on a retail unit.
## Localization
Localization should be plan from day one and watched out for at every step of development.
### Unicode
It was introduced to address limitation of ANSI standard (where string is array of eight-bit characters).
Idea of *unicode* is to assign every character or glyph from every language in common use to a unique hexadecimal code - *code point*.
When storing a string of characters, we select *encoding* - a specific means of representing Unicode points for each character, and following those rules, we lay down a sequence of bits in memory that represents the string.
[[The absolute minimum every software developer absolutely, positively must know about unicode and character sets]]
#### UTF-32
This encoding wastes a lot of memory. Since highest code point is 0x10FFFF, we would beed 21 bits for encoding, not 32. Usually, most of Western European countries do not use any of the highest-valued code points, so 16 bits would be sufficient.
That said, UTF-32 is fixed-length. Every character occupies the same number of bits.
#### UTF-8
In the UTF-8 encoding scheme, the code points for each character in a string are stored using eight-bit (one-byte) granularity, but some code points occupy more than one byte. Hence the number of bytes occupied by a UTF-8 character string is not necessarily the length of the string in characters. This is known as a variable-length encoding, or a multibyte character set (MBCS), because each character in a string may take one or more bytes of storage.
#### UTF-16
Simpler, albeit more expensive approach.
String is represented by one or two 16-bit values.
Also known as WCS.
In UTF-16 the set of all possible Unicode code points is divided into 17 planes containing 2<sup>16</sup> code points each. The first plane is known as basic multilingual plane (**BMP**). Contains most commonly used code points across a wide range of languages.
Many UTF-16 strings can be represented by this first plane, meaning each character in string like that is 16-bit value.
If the character from one of the other planes is required, it is represented by two 16-bit values.
The UCS-2 (2-byte universal character set) encoding is a limited subset of the UTF-16 encoding, utilizing only the basic multilingual page. As such, it cannot represent characters whose Unicode code points are numerically higher than 0xFFFF. This simplifies the format, because every character is guaranteed to occupy exactly 16 bits (two bytes). In other words, UCS-2 is a fixed-length character encoding, while in general UTF-8 and UTF-16 are variable-length encodings.
If we know a priori that a UTF-16 string only utilizes code points from the BMP (or if we are dealing with a UCS-2 encoded string), we can determine the number of characters in the string by simply dividing the number of bytes by two. Of course, if supplemental planes are used in a UTF-16 string, this simple “trick” no longer works.
Since UTF-16 can be little or big endian, the byte order mark was introduced.
### Char versus wchar_t
Standard C/C++ provides two data types for handling strings.
Char is intended to use with legacy ANSI strings.
wchar_t is platform specific - it could be 8 bits on a system that not support Unicode at all. It could be 16 bits if the UCS-2 encoding is assumed or id a multi-word encoding like UTF-16 is employed. It could even be 32 bits for UTF-32.
**If you need to write truly portable string-handling code, you’ll need to define your own character data type(s) and provide a library of functions for dealing with whatever Unicode encoding(s) you need to support.**
### Unicode versus Windows
Windows provides `wchar_t` for UTF-16, `char` for ANSI strings and legacy *Windows code page* string encodings. 
Windows API defines three sets of string manipulation functions - one for single-bytes character set ANSI strings, one for multibyte character set strings, one for wide character set strings.
![[Pasted image 20250314165708.png]]
**Windows provides also functions to translate between those strings.**
The generic character data type TCHAR is defined to be a typedef to char when building your application in “ANSI mode,” and it’s defined to be a typedef to wchar_t when building your application in “Unicode mode.” The macro `_T()` is used to convert an eight-bit string literal (e.g., `char* s = "this is a string";`) into a wide string literal (e.g., `wchar_t* s = L"this is a string";`) when compiling in “Unicode mode.”
Likewise, a suite of “fake” API functions are provided that “automagically” morph into their appropriate 8-bit or 16-bit variant, depending on whether you are building in “Unicode mode” or not. These magic character-set-independent functions are either named with no prefix or suffix, or with a “t,” “tcs” or “T” prefix or suffix.
### Unicode on consoles
Xbox 360 uses WCS everywhere. It is good approach, but leads to waste of memory.
At Naughty Dog, studio uses eight-bit char strings throughout our engine, and it handles foreign languages via a UTF-8 encoding. The choice of encoding is not particularly important, as long as you select one as early in the project as possible and stick with it consistently.
### Other localization concerns
The most crucial components in your localization system will be the central database of human-readable strings and an in-game system for looking up those strings by id. For example, let’s say you want a heads-up display that lists the score of each player with “Player 1 Score:” and “Player 2 Score:” labels and that also displays the text “Player 1 Wins” or “Player 2 Wins” at the end of a round. These four strings would be stored in the localization database under unique ids that are understandable to you, the developer of the game. So our database might use the ids “p1score,” “p2score,” “p1wins” and “p2wins,” respectively.
At runtime, you’ll need to provide a simple function that returns the Unicode string in the “current” language, given the unique id of that string. The function might be declared like this:
```
	wchat_t getLocalizedString(const char* id);
	void drawScoreHud(const Vector3& score1Pos,
					const Vector3& score2Pos)
	{
		renderer.displayTextOrtho(getLocalizedString("p1score"), score1Pos);
		renderer.displayTextOrtho(getLocalizedString("p2score"), score2Pos);
	}
```
Of course, you’ll need some way to set the “current” language globally. The setting is not difficult to implement; it can be as simple as a global integer variable specifying the index of the column in the string table from which to read 
Once you have this infrastructure in place, you must remember to never display a raw string to the user.
