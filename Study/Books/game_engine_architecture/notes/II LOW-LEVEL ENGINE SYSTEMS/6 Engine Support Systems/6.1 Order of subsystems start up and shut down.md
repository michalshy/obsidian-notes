## Begin
Subsystems are usually initialized in some desired order.
In C++, we would want to create instances before main, although static created objects provide no order of creation. If one system would be dependent on another, we would have no control over creation and destruction, thus creating those systems like this:
```
class RenderManager
{
public:
	RenderManager()
	{
		//start up
	}
	~RenderManager()
	{
		//shut down
	}
}
```
would not work.

In C++, static variable declared in function will be defined on first call of this function. That is why we can use other approach.
```
class RenderManager
{
public:
	//Get the one and only instance
	static RenderManager& get()
	{
		static RenderManager sSingleton;
		return sSingleton;
	}
	RenderManager()
	{
		//start up other managers
		VideoManager::get();
		...
	}
	~RenderManager()
	{
		//shut down
	}
}
```

Singleton might also be allocated dynamically
```
static RenderManager& get()
{
	static RenderManager* gpSingleton = nullptr;
	if(gpSingleton == nullptr)
	{
		gpSingleton = new RenderManager();
	}
	ASSERT(gpSingleton);
	return *gpSingleton
	
}

```
Still, we have no control over destructions.
The design pattern is dangerous - programmer might not expect get to allocate some memory dynamically.
## Simple Approach that works

If programmer wants to stick with singleton -> make explicit functions to start up in classes, and make constructors do nothing.

```
class RenderManager()
{
public:
	RenderManager()
	{
		//do nothing
	}
	~RenderManager()
	{
		//do nothing
	}
	void startUp()
	{
		//start manager
	}
	void shutDown()
	{
		//shut manager
	}
}
class PhysicsManager { /* similar */ }
class AnimationManager { /* similar */ }
class MemoryManager { /* similar */ }

...

RenderManager gRenderManager;
PhysicsManager gPhysicsManager;
AnimationManager gAnimationManager;
MemoryManager gMemoryManager;

...

int main()
{

	gRenderManager.startUp();
	// start rest

	gSimulationManager.run()

	gRenderManager.shutDown();
	// shut everything (reverse order)

	return 0;
}
```

Pros:
- Simple and easy to implement
- Explicit
- Easy to debug and maintain
Cons:
- watch out for **ORDER**
