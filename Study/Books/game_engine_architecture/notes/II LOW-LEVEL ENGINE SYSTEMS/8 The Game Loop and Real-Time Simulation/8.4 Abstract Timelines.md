In game programming, consider *abstract timelines.*
Timeline - continuous, one dimensional axis, whose origin may be in arbitrary location relative to other timelines in the system.
Implemented via simple clock variable which stores time values either in `int` or `float`.
### Real time.
Time measured directly via CPU's high-resolution registers. Origin of this timeline is the last CPU power up or reset. It measures time in CPU cycles, but conversion is possible by multiplying cycles with frequency of high-resolution timer on the CPU.
### Game time.
Game time may be created technically independently from real time. It will not be updated if we pause the game, or it will be updated slower if we will slow down time in the game. Pausing might be usable debugging tool. To track down anomaly developer can pause game in order to freeze action. Meanwhile, the rendering engine will continue to run and will enable developer to fly around with debug-camera governed by other clock (real/clock). Engine can allow for single stepping, where clock advances 1 frame on, for example, button press.  
When using the approach described above, it’s important to realize that the game loop is still running when the game is paused—only the game clock has stopped. Single-stepping the game by adding 1/30 of a second to a paused game clock is not the same thing as setting a breakpoint in your main loop, and then hitting the F5 key repeatedly to run one iteration of the loop at a time.
### Local and Global timelines.
All sorts of other timelines might be used. Animation or audio clip can have local timeline (with t = 0 - marking start of the clip). Clip might be played faster, slower or even backwards, by *mapping* between local and global timeline.
