Graphical user interface (GUI) have been drawn via a technique known as *rectangle invalidation.* In this technique only small portion of screen whose contents have changed are redrawn.  
Since in real time 3d computer graphic simulation camera moves and changes continually the window, rectangle invalidation is no applicable.
To render such a simulation series of still images in rapid succession is necessary. This succession is usually implemented via **loop.**
This loop is called **render loop.**
It structure is following
```
while(!quit)
{
	//Update camera transformation 
	//based on inputs or path following
	updateCamera();
	//update positions, orientations
	//and other visual state of dynamic elements
	updateSceneElements();
	//Render still frame into off screen frame buffer
	//"back buffer"
	renderScene();
	//swap buffers
	swapBuffers();
}
```
