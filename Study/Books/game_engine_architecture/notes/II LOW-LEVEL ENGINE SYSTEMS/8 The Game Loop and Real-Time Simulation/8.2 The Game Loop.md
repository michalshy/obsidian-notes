Game requires many interactive systems:
- I/O devices
- rendering
- animation
- collision detection and resolution
- rigid body dynamics simulation
- multiplayer networking
- audio
- etc...
Most subsystems require *servicing* which is updating state of said system.
*Rate* in which subsystems will be serviced differs.
(E.G animation 30/60Hz while physics 120Hz).
There are number of ways to implement periodic updating, lets stick with simplest way - using single loop, called *GAME LOOP*
### Pong
Following pseudocode demonstrates what the game loop of a pong game might look like at its core
```
void main()
{
	initGame()
	while(true) //gameLoop
	{
		if(quitButtonPressed())
		{
			break;
		}
		movePaddles();
		moveBall();
		collideAndBounceBall();
		if(ballImpactedSide(LEFT_PLAYER))
		{
			incrementScore(RIGHT_PLAYER);
			resetBall();
		}
		else if(ballImpactedSide(RIGHT_PLAYER))
		{
			incrementScore(LEFT_PLAYER);
			resetBall();
		}
		renderPlayfield();
	}
}
```
