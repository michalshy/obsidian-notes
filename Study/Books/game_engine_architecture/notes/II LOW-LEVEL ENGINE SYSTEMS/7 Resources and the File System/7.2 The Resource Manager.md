# Entry
Every game has lots of *resources* (*media* or *assets*). Game resources must be managed, Therefore, each game engine has resource manager.
**Every resource manager has two distinct but integrated components.**
One manages the chain of offline tools used to create the assets and transform them into their engine-ready form.
The other component manages the resources at runtime, ensuring that they are loaded into memory in advance of being needed by the game and making sure they are unloaded when not needed.
Sometimes resource manager is one, unified, other times it is a bunch of different systems.
No matter the architecture, resource manager takes certain tasks and solves well-understood set of problems.
# [[Offline Resource Management and the Tool Chain]]
