Typical actions handled by engine file system:
- manipulating file names and paths
- opening, closing, reading and writing individual files
- scanning contents of directory
- handling asynchronous file I/O requests (*streaming*)

## File names and Paths
Path usually consists optional *volume specifier* followed by a sequence of *path components* separated by a reserved path separator (`/` or `\`).
Each component names a directory along the route from the root dir to the file or directory in question.
### Differences across OS'es
- UNIX uses a `/` as path component separator, while DOS and older versions of Windows `\`. Recent Windows versions allow forward or backward slash (so `/` or `\`), but some apps still fail to accept it.
- Mac OS 8 and 9 use the colon `:` as the path separator component. Mac OS X is based on BSD UNIX so it uses `/`
- Some filenames consider paths and filenames to be case-sensitive.
- UNIX and its variants don't support volumes as separate directory hierarchies. Entire file system is contained within a single hierarchy, and local disk drives, network drives and other resources are mounted.
- On Windows volumes can be specify in two way. Local drives by using letter and single colon `C:` while network drives can be mounted so it looks like local drive or it can be referenced via `\\some-computer\some-share`.
- In recent Windows implementations file names can have any number of dots (like in UNIX) but final dot is still interpreted as file extension by many applications.
- Each system disallows some characters in file names.
- UNIX and Windows have the concept of *current working directory* - CWD
- OS'es that support multiple volumes have concept of the *current working volume.* 
- Consoles often also employ a set of predefined path prefixes to represent multiple volumes.
### Absolute and relative paths
All paths are specified relative to some location within the file system. When a path is specified relative to the root directory, we call it an *absolute path*. When it is relative to some other directory in the file system hierarchy, we call it a *relative path*.
Absolute paths:
Windows
- `C:\Windows\System32`
- `D:\`
- `\`
- `\\joe-ddell\Shared-files\img.jpg`
UNIX
- `/usr/local/bin/grep`
- `/`
Relative paths:
Windows:
- `System32`
- `X:animation\walk.anim`
UNIX:
- `bin\grep`
### Search paths
String containing list of paths, each separated by special character, which is searched when looking for a file.
Some game engines also use search paths to locate resource files. For example, the OGRE rendering engine uses a resource search path contained in a text file named resources.cfg. The file provides a simple list of directories and ZIP archives that should be searched in order when trying to find an asset. That said, searching for assets at runtime is a time-consuming proposition. Usually there’s no reason our assets’ paths cannot be known a priori. Presuming this is the case, we can avoid having to search for assets at all—which is clearly a superior approach.

### Path APIs
There are many things which may be need to do when dealing with *paths* such as isolating the directory, filename and extension, canonicalizing a path, converting back and forth between absolute and relative paths. It can be useful to have **API**  for these tasks.
Microsoft Windows provides an API, which is exposed via `shlwapi.h`
Documentation: http://msdn2. microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb773559(VS.85).aspx
Sony provides similar API on Playstation.
Usually engines provides it own API which could be thin wrapper around the native API or it could be whole **file system** written from scratch.
## Basic file I/O
C standard library provides two APIs for management of files - unbuffered and buffered one.
![[Pasted image 20250316224006.png]]
Every file I/O API requires data blocks known as buffers to serve as the source or destination of the bytes passing between the program and the file on disk. We say a file I/O API is buffered when the API manages the necessary input and output data buffers for you. With an unbuffered API, it is the responsibility of the programmer using the API to allocate and manage the data buffers.
Some game teams find it useful to manage their own buffers. For example, the Red Alert 3 team at Electronic Arts observed that writing data into log files was causing significant performance degradation. They changed the logging system so that it accumulated its output into a memory buffer, writing the buffer out to disk only when it was filled. Then they moved the buffer dump routine out into a separate thread to avoid stalling the main game loop.
### To wrap or not to wrap
Many game engines wrap the file I/O API in a library of custom I/O functions.
Then, engine can guarantee identical behavior across all target platforms.
Also, the API can be simplified to functions required by engine.
Finally, extended functionality can be provided.
### Synchronous File I/O
Both of the standard C file I/O libs are *synchronous.*
Notice how the function does not return until all data has been read into the buffer provided.
```
bool syncReadFile(const char* filePath,
					U8* buffer,
					size_t bufferSize,
					size_t& rBytesRead)
{
	FILE* handle = fopen(filePath, "rb");
	if(handle)
	{
		//BLOCK here until all data has been read
		size_t bytesRead = fread(buffer, 1, bufferSize, handle);
		int err = ferror(handle); //get error if any
		fclose(handle);
		if(0==error)
		{
			fBytesRead = bytesRead;
			return true;
		}
	}
	rBytesRead = 0;
	return false;
}
```
### Asynchronous File I/O
*Streaming* refers to loading data in the background while the main program continues to run. Many games provide the player with seamless, load-screen-free playing experience by streaming data for upcoming levels.
Audio and texture data are probably the most commonly streamed types of data, but any type of data can be streamed.
```
AsyncRequestHandle g_hRequest;
u8 g_asyncBuffer[512];
static void asyncReadComplete(AsyncRequestHandle hRequest);
void main()
{
	
	// NOTE: This call to asyncOpen() might itself be an 
	// asynchronous call, but we'll ignore that detail 
	// here and just assume it's a blocking function. 
	AsyncFileHandle hFile = asyncOpen( "C:\\testfile.bin");
	if (hFile) 
	{ 
		// This function requests an I/O read, then 
		// returns immediately (non-blocking). 
		g_hRequest = asyncReadFile( hFile, // file handle 
							g_asyncBuffer, // input buffer
							sizeof(g_asyncBuffer), // size of buffer
							asyncReadComplete); // callback function 
	} 
	// Now go on our merry way... 
	// (This loop simulates doing real work while we wait 
	// for the I/O read to complete.) 
	for (;;) 
	{ 
		OutputDebugString("zzz...\n"); 
		Sleep(50); 
	} 
} 
// This function will be called when the data has been read. 
static void asyncReadComplete(AsyncRequestHandle hRequest) 
{ 
	if (hRequest == g_hRequest && asyncWasSuccessful(hRequest)) 
	{ 
		// The data is now present in g_asyncBuffer[] and 
		// can be used. Query for the number of bytes 
		// actually read: 
		size_t bytes = asyncGetBytesReadOrWritten( hRequest); 
		char msg[256]; 
		snprintf(msg, sizeof(msg), "async success, read %u bytes\n",
						bytes); 
		OutputDebugString(msg); 
	} 
}
```
Notice that the asyncReadFile() function returns immediately— the data is not present in the buffer until our callback function asyncReadComplete() has been called by the I/O library.
Most asynchronous I/O libraries permit main program to wait for operation to complete. This can be useful when a limited amount of work can be done before the results are needed.
```
u8 g_asyncBuffer[512];
void main()
{
	AsyncRequestHandle hRequest = ASYNC_INVALID_HANDLE;
	AsyncFileHandle hFile = asyncOpen("C:\\testfile.bin");
	if(hFile)
	{
		// This function requests an I/O read, then 
		// returns immediately (non-blocking). 
		g_hRequest = asyncReadFile( hFile, // file handle 
							g_asyncBuffer, // input buffer
							sizeof(g_asyncBuffer), // size of buffer
							nullptr); // no callback 
	}
	//now some limited amount of work
	for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	{
		OutputDebugString("zzz...\n"); 
		Sleep(50);
	}
	//now imagine we have to wait
	asyncWait(hRequest);
	if(asyncWasSuccesful(hRequest))
	{
		// The data is now present in g_asyncBuffer[] and 
		// can be used. Query for the number of bytes 
		// actually read: 
		size_t bytes = asyncGetBytesReadOrWritten( hRequest); 
		char msg[256]; 
		snprintf(msg, sizeof(msg), "async success, read %u bytes\n", bytes); 
		OutputDebugString(msg);
	}
}
```
Some asynchronous I/O libraries allow the programmer to ask for an estimate of how long a particular asynchronous operation will take to complete. Some APIs also allow you to set deadlines on a request (which effectively prioritizes the request relative to other pending requests), and to specify what happens when a request misses its deadline (e.g., cancel the request, notify the program and keep trying, etc.)
### Priorities
I/O operations often have varying priorities. For example, if we are streaming audio from the hard disk or Blu-ray and playing it on the fly, loading the next buffer-full of audio data is clearly higher priority than, say, loading a texture or a chunk of a game level.
### How Asynchronous File I/O works
**Asynchronous file I/O works by handling I/O requests in a separate thread. The main thread calls functions that simply place requests on a queue and then return immediately. Meanwhile, the I/O thread picks up requests from the queue and handles them sequentially using blocking I/O routines like read() or fread(). When a request is completed, a callback provided by the main thread is called, thereby notifying it that the operation is done. If the main thread chooses to wait for an I/O request to complete, this is handled via a semaphore.**
